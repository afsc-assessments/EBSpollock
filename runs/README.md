# EBS pollock 2017
## Tasks and todo list
    [x] Make new branch, call it 2017
    [x] Get updated AT age and index data (down to 0.5 m)
    [x] Get haul-based sample sizes
    [x] Add in survey biomass     
    [x] Rescale survey biomass covariance matrix
    [x] Update catches     
    [x] Add in 2016 fishery age compositions      
    [x] Add in 2017 survey age compositions     
    [x] re-run wt.tpl with updated survey and fishery data to get new variance params for REs, in 2017 this was done in fishBodyMassAtAge repo
    [ ] Modify code to accommodate time-varying M
    [ ] Figure out which models to use going forward     

## Data sensitivities
	Followed C, CA, CAB, CABE method      
    16.1 final model, 16.1a and 16.1b have different SRR assumptions (moderate and diffuse conditioning of data)
    16.1m has M profiles (done w/ arcit.sh changed to mprof.sh)
