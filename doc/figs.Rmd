![Bottom-trawl survey biomass estimates with approximate 95% confidence bounds (density-dependent correction method; DDC) for EBS pollock, 1982-2016, bottom panel. These estimates include the northern strata except for 1982-84, and 1986. Horizontal line represents the long-term mean. The top panel shows the design-based estimates (DB) together with the density dependence-corrected (DDC) series and three specifications of a random-effects geostatistical approach (Thorson 2016)

The bottom panel shows the raw log-abundances at age while the top panel shows the estimates of total mortality by cohort (the 2007 year-class had anomalous increases in abundance from age 5-8).

![EBS pollock profile likelihood over fixed values of age 3+ natural mortality under Model 16.1 showing negative log-likelihood selected components differences relative to the minimum value for the grid of M=0.1 to 0.3. Note that the range was selected based on initial attempts to estimate M within the assessment and that this is for expository purposes only (the fact that the survey age composition favors lower natural mortality is likely due to dynamics affecting availability of pollock in recent years—i.e., movement into the region).


![Schematic of EBS pollock fishery data (top) and model fits to estimate mean body weights-at-age (kg; bottom). Ages are in columns, years are in rows. Residuals expressed as (observed-predicted)/observed. Note that the data remain in the model and are used for computing fishery catch biomass, but model predictions for 2016-2018 (and their associated uncertainty shown in last three rows of lower-right table) are used for Tier 1 model projections and ABC/OFL estimates for models using these estimates.

![EBS pollock Model 16.1 fits to AT biomass estimates (top) and BTS estimates (bottom). The four panels for each survey are for incremental additions of data to the current assessment (C=fishery catch only, CA adds in fishery catch-age data, CAB adds in BTS data, and CABE represents addition of echo integration AT data). Note that dots without error bars means that data point was excluded from estimation.

Error bars represent two standard deviations from the estimates.
