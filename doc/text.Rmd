# Executive summary

This chapter covers the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) region—the Aleutian Islands
region (Chapter 1A) and the Bogoslof Island area (Chapter 1B) are presented
separately (this year only updates--"full"  assessments expected in 2018). 

###Summary of changes in assessment inputs

Relative to last year’s BSAI SAFE report, the
following substantive changes have been made in the EBS pollock stock
assessment.

####Changes in the data

   1.	The 2017 NMFS bottom-trawl survey (BTS) biomass and abundance at age estimates were included. 

   2.	The 2016 NMFS acoustic-trawl survey (ATS) biomass and abundance at age estimates were updated based on
      age data collected from the ATS sampling (in 2016 the BTS age-length key was used). 
   2.  The ATS age data from 1994-2016 that includes the bottom layer analysis (0.5-3m from bottom) was completed and used 
   		in the base/reference model (last year the accompanying biomass time series for these data were evaluated but the full set of 
   		age data was unavailable).
   2.  Two additional years of opportunistic acoustic data from vessels transiting the EBS shelf region 
     were processed and the time series now extends from 2006-2017. This provides an alternative
     index of pollock biomass in mid-water.
   2.	Observer data for catch-at-age and average weight-at-age from the 2016 fishery were finalized and included.
   2.	Total catch as reported by NMFS Alaska Regional office was updated and included through `r thisyr`.

###Changes in the assessment methods

There were no changes to the assessment methods.

## Response to SSC and Plan Team comments

### General comments
The Plan Teams noted that a compilation of responses to CIE reviews be
included in order to maximise their benefit and to promote transparency.

_A table summarizing key aspects from the three reviews conducted in 2016 and 
responses is provided._

###Comments specific to this assessment

In the September 2016 minutes, the BSAI Plan Team recommended: \" ...that the
authors develop a better prior for steepness, or at least a better rationale,
and perhaps consider a meta-analytic approach.  
...In the long term, the Team recommends evaluating the sample sizes used 
for the data weighting and pursuing other CIE suggestions.

_Input sample size estimates for fishery and surveys were re-evaluated in 2016

#Introduction

##General

Walleye pollock (_Gadus chalcogrammus_; hereafter referred to as pollock) are
broadly distributed throughout the North Pacific with the largest
concentrations found in the Eastern Bering Sea. Also  known as
Alaska pollock, this species continues to play important roles ecologically
and economically.

##Review of Life History
In the EBS pollock spawn generally in the period March-May and in relatively
localized regions during specific periods (Bailey 2000). Generally spawning begins
nearshore north of Unimak Island in March and April and later near the Pribilof Islands
(Jung et al. 2006, Bacheler et al. 2010).
Females are "iterative" spawners with up to 10 batches of eggs per female per year.
Eggs and larvae of EBS pollock are planktonic for a period of about 90 days
and appear to be sensitive to environmental conditions. These conditions
likely affect their dispersal into favorable areas (for subsequent separation
from predators) and also affect general food requirements for over-wintering
survival (Gann et al. 2015, Heintz et al., 2013, Hunt et al. 2011). Pollock as
feeders in the ecosystem have been considered to impact their forage with 
relatively high consumption rates as young-of-the year (e.g., Ciannelli et al. 2004).
Duffy-Anderson et al. (2015) provide a review of the early life history of EBS pollock.


Throughout their range juvenile pollock feed on a variety of planktonic
crustaceans,  including calanoid copepods and euphausiids. In the EBS shelf
region, one-year-old pollock are found throughout the water column, but also
commonly occur in the NMFS bottom trawl survey. Ages 2 and 3 year old pollock
are rarely caught in summer bottom trawl survey gear and are more common
in the  midwater zone as detected by mid-water acoustic trawl
surveys. Younger pollock are  generally found in the more northern parts of
the survey area and a pattern of  movement to the southeast occurs as they age
(Buckley et al. 2009). Euphausiids, principally _Thysanoessa inermis_ and _T.
raschii_, are among the most important prey items for pollock in the Bering
Sea (Livingston, 1991; Lang et al., 2000; Brodeur et al., 2002; Cianelli et
al., 2004; Lang et al., 2005).  Their diets with age  become more piscivorous
and cannibalism has been commonly observed for this  region. However, Buckley
et al. (2016) showed spatial patterns of pollock foraging by size of
predators. For example, the northern part of the the shelf region between the 100 and 200 m isobaths (closest to the
shelf break) tends to be more piscivorous than counterparts in other areas.


##Stock structure

New information available from ecosystem survey work in the Northern Bering
Sea (NBS) region (north of Nunivak Island to the Russian convention line and
into Norton Sound)  suggests considerably more pollock present there compared
to the 2010 survey (1.3 million t in 2017 compared to 11 kt in 2010).
Although the 2017 bottom temperatures were colder than recent years, the warm
conditions in 2016 may have caused a portion of the pollock stock to move into
this region. A loose relationship was determined ($R^2$ of 0.43) between mean
bottom temperature in the US zone on the EBS shelf and subsequent biomass
estimates in the  Navarin basin (the Russian area adjacent to the Convention
Line; Ianelli et al. 2011). However,  the extent that this may occur between
years is unknown and more detailed evaluation of the NBS data will be
forthcoming. Fortunately, genetic samples were taken from pollock and pending
funding availability, should help to ascertain the extent that these fish are
related to those observed in the normal EBS shelf survey area.   Genetic
samples taken from 2017 RACE summer survey from the Northern Bering Sea can be
compared with samples from the standard Bering Sea Unimak, Pribilof, and
Zhemchug, to ascertain the extent that these fish are related.


#Fishery 
##Description of the directed fishery
Since the late 1970s, the average EBS pollock catch has been about 1.2 million t, ranging from 0.815
million t in 2009 to nearly 1.5 million t during 2003-2006 (Table \ref{tab:catch}). During a 10-year period, catches by foreign vessels operating in the “Donut Hole”
region of the Aleutian Basin were substantial totaling nearly 7 million t
(Table \ref{tab:catch}).  A fishing moratorium was enacted in 1993 and only
trace amounts of pollock have been harvested from the Aleutian Basin region
since then. United States vessels began fishing for pollock in 1980 and
by 1987 they were able to take 99% of the quota. Since 1988, only U.S. vessels
have been operating in this fishery. Observers collected data aboard the
foreign vessels since the late 1970s. The current observer program for the
domestic fishery formally began in 1991 and has since then regularly re-
evaluated the sampling protocol and making adjustments where needed to improve
efficiency. Since 2011, regulations require that all vessels participating in
the pollock fishery carry at least one observer. Prior to this time about
70-80% of the catch was observed at sea or during dockside offloading. 
Historically, EBS pollock catches were low until directed foreign fisheries
began in 1964. Catches increased rapidly during the late 1960s and reached a
peak in 1970-75 when they ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 million t annually. Following
the peak catch in 1972, bilateral agreements with Japan and the USSR resulted
in reductions. Historical catch estimates used in the assessment, along with management
measures (i.e., ABCs and TACs) are shown in Table \ref{tab:abc_tac}. 


###Catch patterns

The \“A-season\” for directed EBS pollock fishing opens on January 20th and
extends into early-mid April. During this season, the fishery produces highly
valued roe that, under optimal conditions, can comprise over 4% of the catch
in weight. The second, or “B-season” presently opens on June 10th and extends
through noon on November 1st. The A-season fishery concentrates primarily
north and west of Unimak Island depending on ice conditions and fish
distribution. There has also been effort along the 100m depth contour (and
deeper) between Unimak Island and the Pribilof Islands. The general pattern by
season (and area) has varied over time with recent B-season catches
occuring in the southeast portion of the shelf (east of 170$^\circ$W longitude;
Fig. \ref{fig:catch}). Since 2011, regulations and industry-based measures to
reduce salmon bycatch have affected the spatial distribution of the fishery
and to some degree, the way individual vessel operators fish (Stram and
Ianelli, 2014).



The catch estimates by sex for the seasons indicate that over time, the number
of males and females has been fairly equal (Fig. \ref{fig:catch_sex}). The
2017 A-season fishery spatial pattern had relatively high concentrations of
fishing on the shelf north of Unimak Island, especially compared to the
pattern observed in 2015 when most fishing activity occurred farther north
(Fig. \ref{fig:catch_distn_a}).  The 2017 A-season catch rates continued to be
high following the good conditions observed in the 2016 summer-fall period
(Fig. \ref{fig:aseas_cpue}). Also of note for this year was that, due to  a
regulatory change, up to 45\% of the TAC could be taken in the A-season. This
conservation measure was made to allow greater flexibility to avoid Chinook
salmon in the B-season. To date, it appears that the pollock fleet as a whole
took advantage of  this added flexibility (Fig. \ref{fig:prop_a_season}).

The 2017 summer and fall (B-season) fishing had a pattern that seems
intermediate to 2016 and 2015 (Fig. \ref{fig:catch_distn_b}).  The fleet-wide
catch per hour fished was lower than that observed in 2016 for  the B-season
but was still quite good compared to other recent years (Fig. \ref{fig:bseas_cpue}). 
Since 1979 the catch of EBS pollock has averaged 1.19
million t with the lowest catches occurring in 2009 and 2010 when the limits
were set to 0.81 million t due to stock declines (Table \ref{tab:abc_tac}).
Pollock retained and discarded catch (based on NMFS observer estimates) in the
Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands for 1991-`r thisyr` are shown in (Table
\ref{tab:catch_disc}). Since 1991, estimates of discarded pollock have ranged
from a high of 9.1% of total pollock catch in 1992 to recent lows of around
0.6%. These low values reflect the implementation of the Council’s Improved
Retention /Improved Utilization program. Prior to the implementation of the
American Fisheries Act (AFA) in 1999, higher discards may have occurred under the “race for fish” and
incidental catch of pollock that were below marketable sizes. Since
implementation of the AFA, the vessel operators have more time to pursue
optimal sizes of pollock for market since the quota is allocated to vessels
(via cooperative arrangements). In addition, several vessels have made gear
modifications to avoid retention of smaller pollock. In all cases, the
magnitude of discards counts as part of the total catch for management (to
ensure the TAC is not exceeded) and within the assessment. Bycatch of other
non-target, target, and prohibited species is presented in the section titled
Ecosystem Considerations below. In that section it is noted that the bycatch
of pollock in other target fisheries is more than double the bycatch of other
target species (e.g., Pacific cod) in the pollock fishery.


##Management measures

The EBS pollock stock is managed by NMFS regulations that provide limits on
seasonal catch. The NMFS observer program data provide near real-time
statistics during the season and vessels operate within well-defined limits.
TACs have commonly been set well below the ABC value and catches have usually
stayed within these constraints (Table \ref{tab:abc_tac}). Allocations of the TAC split
first with 10% to western Alaska communities as part of the Community
Development Quota (CDQ) program and the remainder between at-sea processors
and shore-based sectors. For a characterization of the CDQ program see Haynie (2014). 
Seung and Ianelli (2016) combined a fish population dynamics
model with an economic model to evaluate regional impacts.

Due to concerns that groundfish fisheries may impact the rebuilding of the
Steller sea lion population, a number of management measures have been
implemented over the years. Some measures were designed to reduce the
possibility of competitive interactions between fisheries and Steller sea
lions. For the pollock fisheries, seasonal fishery catch and pollock biomass
distributions (from surveys) indicated that the apparent disproportionately
high seasonal harvest rates within Steller sea lion critical habitat could
lead to reduced sea lion prey densities. Consequently, management measures
redistributed the fishery both temporally and spatially according to pollock
biomass distributions. This was intended to disperse fishing so that localized
harvest rates were more consistent with annual exploitation rates. The
measures include establishing: 1) pollock fishery exclusion zones around sea
lion rookery or haulout sites; 2) phased-in reductions in the seasonal
proportions of TAC that can be taken from critical habitat; and 3) additional
seasonal TAC releases to disperse the fishery in time.

Prior to adoption of the above management measures, the pollock fishery
occurred in each of the three major NMFS management regions of the North
Pacific Ocean: the Aleutian Islands (1,001,780 km$^2$  inside the EEZ), the
Eastern Bering Sea (968,600 km$^2$), and the Gulf of Alaska (1,156,100 km$^2$). The
marine portion of Steller sea lion critical habitat in Alaska west of 150 $^{\circ}$ W
encompasses 386,770 km$^2$ of ocean surface, or 12\% of the fishery management
regions.

Prior to 1999, 84,100 km$^2$, or 22\% of critical habitat was closed to the
pollock fishery. Most of this closure consisted of the 10 and 20 nm radius
all-trawl fishery exclusion zones around sea lion rookeries (48,920 km$^2$, or
13% of critical habitat). The remainder was largely management area 518
(35,180 km$^2$, or 9% of critical habitat) that was closed pursuant to an
international agreement to protect spawning stocks of central Bering Sea
pollock.

In 1999, an additional 83,080 km$^2$ (21%) of critical habitat in the Aleutian
Islands was closed to pollock fishing along with 43,170 km$^2$  (11%) around sea
lion haulouts in the GOA and Eastern Bering Sea. In 1998, over 22,000 t of
pollock were caught in the Aleutian Island region, with over 17,000 t taken
within critical habitat region. Between 1999 and 2004 a directed fishery for
pollock was prohibited in this region. Subsequently, 210,350 km$^2$  (54%) of
critical habitat was closed to the pollock fishery. In 2000 the remaining
phased-in reductions in the proportions of seasonal TAC that could be caught
within the BSAI Steller sea lion Conservation Area (SCA) were implemented.

On the EBS shelf, an estimate (based on observer at-sea data) of the
proportion of pollock caught in the SCA has averaged about 38% annually.
During the A-season, the average is about 42% (in part because pre-spawning
pollock are more concentrated in this area during this period). The proportion
of pollock caught within the SCA varies considerably, presumably due to
temperature regimes and population age structure. The annual proportion of
catch within the SCA varies and has ranged from an annual low of 11% in 2010
to high of 60% in 1998 followed by a preliminary value of 53% in 2017 (Table \ref{tab:catch_sca}). 
The high values in recent years was likely due to good fishing conditions close to the main port.

The AFA reduced the capacity of the
catcher/processor fleet and permitted the formation of cooperatives in each
industry sector by the year 2000. Because of some of its provisions, the AFA
gave the industry the ability to respond efficiently to changes mandated for
sea lion conservation and salmon bycatch measures. Without such a catch-share
program, these additional measures would likely have been less effective and
less economical (Strong and Criddle 2014).

An additional strategy to minimize potential adverse effects on sea lion
populations is to disperse the fishery throughout more of the pollock range on
the Eastern Bering Sea shelf. While the distribution of fishing during the
A-season is limited due to ice and weather conditions, there appears to be
some dispersion to the northwest area (Fig. \ref{fig:catch_distn_a}).

The majority (~56\%) of Chinook salmon caught as bycatch in
the pollock fishery originate from western Alaskan rivers. An Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) was completed in 2009 in conjunction with the Council’s
recommended management approach. This EIS evaluated the relative impacts of
different bycatch management approaches as well as estimated the impact of
bycatch levels on adult equivalent salmon (AEQ) returning to river systems
(NMFS/NPFMC 2009). As a result, revised salmon bycatch management measures
went into effect in 2011 which imposed new prohibited species catch (PSC)
limits. These limits, when reached,  close the fishery by sector and season
(Amendment 91 to the Groundfish FMP resulting from the NPFMC’s 2009 action).
Previously, all measures for salmon bycatch imposed seasonal area closures
when PSC levels reached the limit (fishing could continue outside of the
closed areas). The current program imposes a dual cap system by fishing sector
and season. A  goal of this system was to maintain incentives to avoid bycatch
at a broad range of relative salmon abundance. Participants are also required
to take part in an incentive  program agreement (IPA). These IPAs are approved
and reviewed annually by NMFS  to ensure individual vessel accountability. The
fishery has been operating under  rules to implement this program since
January 2011.

Further measures to reduce salmon bycatch in the pollock fishery were
developed and the Council took action on Amendment 110 to the BSAI Groundfish
FMP in April 2015. These additional measures were designed to add protection
for Chinook salmon by imposing more restrictive PSC limits in times of low
western Alaskan Chinook salmon abundance. This included provisions within the
IPAs that reduce fishing in months of higher bycatch encounters and mandate
the use of salmon excluders in trawl nets. These provisions were also included
to manage chum salmon bycatch within the IPAs rather than through Amendment 84
to the FMP. The new measure also included additional seasonal flexibility in
pollock fishing so that more pollock (proportionally) could be caught during
seasons when salmon bycatch rates were low. 
Specifically, an additional 5% of
the pollock can be caught in the A-season (effectively changing the seasonal
allocation from 40% to 45% (as noted above in Fig. \ref{fig:prop_a_season}). 
These measures are all part of Amendment 110 and a
summary of this and other key management measures is provided in Table
\ref{tab:mgt}.



##Economic conditions as of 2016

Alaska pollock is the dominant species in terms of catch in the Bering Sea \&
Aleutian Island (BSAI) region. In 2016 they accounted for 69\% of the BSAI's FMP
groundfish harvest and 88\% of the total pollock harvest in Alaska. Retained
catch of pollock increased 2.4\% to 1.35 million t in 2016. BSAI pollock
first-wholesale value was \$1.35 billion 2016, which was up from \$1.27 billion
in 2015 and above the 2005-2007 average of \$1.25 billion. The higher revenue in
recent years is largely the result of increased catch and production levels as
the average first-wholesale price of pollock products have declined since
peaking in 2008-2010 and since 2013 have been close to the 2005-2007 average,
though this varies across products types.

Pollock is targeted exclusively with pelagic trawl gear. The catch of pollock
in the BSAI was rationalized with the passage of the 
AFA in 1998,\footnote{The AFA was implemented in 1999 for
catcher/processors, and in   2000 for catcher vessel and motherships.} which,
among other things, established a proportional allocation of the total
allowable catch (TAC) among vessels in sectors which were allowed to form into
cooperatives.\footnote{The   BSAI pollock TAC is divided between Community
Development Program (10\% off   the top), with the remaining amount split among shore-based 
catcher vessels (50\%), at-sea catcher/processors (40\%) and motherships (10\%).}  Alaska caught pollock in
the BSAI became certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) in 2005, an
NGO based third-party sustainability certification, which some buyers seek. In
2015 the official U.S. market name changed from "Alaska pollock" to
"pollock" enabling U.S. retailers to differentiate between pollock caught in
Alaska and Russia.

Prior to 2008 pollock catches were high at approximately 1.4 million t in the
BSAI for an extended period (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_exv}). The U.S. accounted
for over 50\% of the global pollock catch (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_wsl}).
Between 2008-2010 conservation reductions in the pollock total allowable catch
(TAC) trimmed catches to an average 867 kt. The supply reduction
resulted in price increases for most pollock products, which mitigated the
short-term revenue loss (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_glbl}). Over this same
period, the pollock catch in Russia increased from an average of 1 million t
in 2005-2007 to 1.4 million t in 2008-2010 and Russia's share of global catch
increased to over 50\% and the U.S. share decreased to 35\%. Russia lacks the
primary processing capacity of the U.S. and much of their catch is exported to
China and is re-processed as twice-frozen fillets. Around the mid- to late-
2000s, buyers in Europe, an important segment of the fillet market, started to
source fish products with the MSC sustainability certification, and 
retailers in the U.S. later began to follow suit. Asian markets, an important
export destination for a number of pollock products, have shown less interest
in requiring MSC certification. The U.S. was the only producer of MSC
certified pollock until 2013 when roughly 50\% of the Russian catch became MSC
certified. Since 2010 the U.S. pollock stock rebounded with catches in the
BSAI ranging from 1.2-1.3 million t and Russia's catch has stabilized at 1.5
to 1.6 million t. The majority of pollock is exported; consequently exchange
rates can have a significant impact on market dynamics, particularly the
Dollar-Yen and Dollar-Euro.\footnote{Aggregate exports in Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_glbl} 
may not fully account for   all pollock exports as products such as meal, 
minced fish and other ancillary product may be coded as generic fish type for export purposes.} 
Additionally, pollock more broadly competes with other whitefish that, to varying degrees, can serve as
substitutes depending on the product.

This market environment accounts for some of the major trends in prices and
production across product types. Fillet prices peaked in 2008-2010 but
declined afterwards because of the greater supply from U.S. and Russia. The
2013 MSC certification of Russian-caught pollock enabled access to segments of
European and U.S. fillet markets, which has put continued downward pressure on
prices. Pollock roe prices and production have declined steadily over the last
decade as international demand has waned with changing consumer preferences in
Asia. Additionally, the supply of pollock roe from Russia has increased with
catch. The net effect has been not only a reduction in the supply of roe from
the U.S. industry, but also a significant reduction in roe prices which are
roughly half pre-2008 levels. Prior to 2008, roe comprised 23\% of the U.S.
wholesale value share, and since 2011 it has been roughly 10\%. With the U.S.
supply reduction in 2008-2010, surimi production from pollock came under
increased pressure as U.S. pollock prices rose and markets sought cheaper
sources of raw materials (see Guenneugues and Ianelli 2013 for a global review
of surimi resources and market). This contributed to a growth in surimi from
warm- water fish of southeast Asia. Surimi prices spiked in 2008-2010 and have
since tapered off as production from warm-water species increased (as has
pollock). A relatively small fraction of pollock caught in Russian waters is
processed as surimi. Surimi is consumed globally, but Asian markets dominate
the demand for surimi and demand has remained strong.

The catch of pollock can be broadly divided between the shore-based sector
where catcher vessels make deliveries to inshore processors, and the at-sea
sector where catch is processed at-sea by catcher/processors and motherships
before going directly to the wholesale markets. The retained catch of the
shore-based sector increased 2.5\% increase to 704 kt. The value of
these deliveries (shore-based ex-vessel value) totaled \$209.4 million in
2016, which was down 7.9\% from the ex-vessel value in 2015, as the increased
catch was offset by a 9.7\% decrease in the ex-vessel price
(Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_exv}). The first-wholesale value of pollock products was
\$808 million for the at-sea sector and \$543 million for the shore-based
sector (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_wsl}). The higher revenue in recent years is
largely the result of increased catch levels as the average price of pollock
products has declined since peaking in 2008-2010 and since 2013 has been
close to the 2005-2007 average, though this varies across products types. The
average price of pollock products in 2016 increased for the at-sea sector and
shore-based sectors, which was largely attributable to an increase in the
price of roe products, though prices increased for fillets and surimi products
as well.

The portfolios of products shore-based and at-sea processors produce are
similar. In both sectors the primary products processed from pollock are
fillets, surimi and roe, with each accounting for approximately 40\%, 35\%,
and 10\% of first-wholesale value (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_wsl}). The price of
products produced at-sea tend to be higher than comparable products produced
shore-based because of the shorter time span between catch, processing and
freezing. The price of fillets produced at-sea tend to be about 6\% higher,
surimi prices tend to be about 20\% higher and the price of roe about 45\%
higher. Average prices for fillets produced at-sea also tend to be higher
because they produce proportionally more higher-priced fillet types (like
deep-skin fillets). The at-sea price first wholesale premium averaged roughly
\$0.30 per pound between 2005-2010 but has decreased to an average of \$0.20
per pound since 2011, in part, because the shore-based sector increased their
relative share of surimi production.\footnote{The at-sea price premium is the
difference between the   average price of first-wholesale products at-sea and
the average price of   first-wholesale products shore-based.}

###Pollock fillets

A variety of different fillets are produced from pollock, with pin-bone-out
(PBO) and deep-skin fillets accounting for approximately 70\% and 30\% of
production in the BSAI, respectively. Total fillet production decreased 3.4\%
to 161 kt in 2016, but since 2010 has increased with aggregate
production and catch and has been higher than the 2005-2007 average
(Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_wsl}). The average price of fillet products in the
BSAI increased 4\% to \$1.41 per pound and is below the inflation adjusted
average price of fillets in 2005-2007 of \$1.46 per pound. Media reports
indicate that headed-and-gutted (H\&G) and fillet prices tended to be low throughout the year. The
small size of fish in the catch, significant inventories, and insolvency of a
major international pollock trader were cited as contributing factors. Low
H\&G prices incentivize Russia producers to upgrade their fillet production
capacity in the near future, though fillets are a small portion of their
primary production. Much of the Russian catch already goes to China for
secondary processing into fillets so this would do little to increase the
overall volume, however, increased primary fillet processing in Russia could
increase competition with U.S. produced single-frozen fillet products.
Approximately 30\% of the fillets produced in Alaska are estimated to remain
in the domestic market, which accounts for roughly 45\% of domestic pollock
fillet consumption.\footnote{Additionally, roughly 10\% of the at-sea   BSAI
production is processed as H\&G which is mostly exported, primarily to
China, where is reprocessed as fillets and some share of which returns to the
U.S.. China also processes H\&G from Russia into fillets which are also
imported into the domestic market. Current data collection does not allow us
to estimate the share of U.S. returning imports.} As recent fillet markets
have become increasingly tight, the industry has tried to maintain value by
increasing domestic marketing for fillet based product and creating product
types that are better suited to the American palette, in addition to increased
utilization of by-products.

###Surimi seafood

Surimi production continued an increasing trend through 2016, but at a more
moderate rate of 1.6\% to 190.8 kt which is above the 2005-2007
average. Prices have increased since 2013 to \$1.19 per pound in the BSAI in
2016 (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_wsl}). Because surimi and fillets are both made
from pollock meat, activity in the fillet market can influence the decision of
processors to produce surimi. Industry news indicated the average size of fish
caught is down, which incentivizes surimi production because it yields a
higher value than fillets. Additionally, the supply of raw surimi material
continues to be constrained in Japan. The high volume of surimi production has
raised concerns that prices may begin to plateau or fall, but the more
favorable exchange rate with Japan in 2016 may have helped to shore up prices.

###Pollock roe

Roe is a high priced product that is the focus of the A season catch destined
primarily for Asian markets. Roe production in the BSAI tapered off in the
late-2000s and since has generally fluctuated at under 20 kt annually,
production averaged 27 kt in 2005-2007 and was 14.3 kt in 2016,
which is 24\% below production in 2015 (Fig. \ref{fig:roe}). Prices peaked in the
mid-2000s and have followed a decreasing trend over the last decade which
continued until 2015. In 2016 roe production from the U.S. and Russia were low
as a result of a smaller average size of fish caught, which also reduced
average grade of roe sold. Lower production and tight inventories put upward
pressure on roe prices. Additionally, the Yen to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was
more favorable in the 2016 than 2015. The net result in the BSAI was a 24\%
price increase in 2016 to \$2.84 per pound, and value was down only 6\% to \$89
million (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_wsl}).

###Fish oil

Using oil production per 100 tons as a basic index (tons of oil per ton
retained catch) shows increases for the at-sea sector. In 2005-2007 it was
0.3\% and starting in 2008 it increased and leveled off after 2010 with  over
1.5\% of the catch being converted to fish oil (Table \ref{tab:bsaiplck_oil}).
This represents about a 5-fold increase in recorded oil production during this
period. Oil production from the shore-based fleet was somewhat higher than the
at-sea processors prior to 2008 but has been relatively stable according to
available records. Oil production estimates from the shore-based fleet may be
biased low because some production occurs at secondary processors (fishmeal
plants) in Alaska. The increased production of oil beginning in 2008 can be
attributed to the steady trend to add more value per ton of fish landed.

##Fishery 
###Catch
The catch-at-age composition was estimated using the methods described by
Kimura (1989) and modified by Dorn (1992). Length-stratified age data are used
to construct age-length keys for each stratum and sex. These keys are then
applied to randomly sampled catch length frequency data. The stratum-specific
age composition estimates are then weighted by the catch within each stratum
to arrive at an overall age composition for each year. Data were collected
through shore-side sampling and at-sea observers. The three strata for the EBS
were:  i) January–June (all areas, but mainly east of 170$^\circ$W); ii) INPFC area
51 (east of 170$^\circ$W) from July–December; and iii) INPFC area 52 (west of 170$^\circ$W)
from July–December. This method was used to derive the age compositions from
1991-2016 (the period for which all the necessary information is readily
available). Prior to 1991, we used the same catch-at-age composition estimates
as presented in Wespestad et al. (1996).

The catch-at-age estimation method uses a two-stage bootstrap re-sampling of
the data. Observed tows were first selected with replacement, followed by re-
sampling actual lengths and age specimens given that set of tows. This method
allows an objective way to specify the effective sample size for fitting
fishery age composition data within the assessment model. In addition,
estimates of stratum-specific fishery mean weights-at-age (and variances) are
provided which are useful for evaluating general patterns in growth and growth
variability. For example, Ianelli et al. (2007) showed that seasonal aspects
of pollock condition factor could affect estimates of mean weight-at-age. They
showed that within a year, the condition factor for pollock varies by more
than 15%, with the heaviest pollock caught late in the year from October-
December (although most fishing occurs during other times of the year) and the
thinnest fish at length tending to occur in late winter. They also showed that
spatial patterns in the fishery affect mean weights, particularly when the
fishery is shifted more towards the northwest where pollock tend to be smaller
at age. In 2011 the winter fishery catch consisted primarily of age 5 pollock
(the 2006 year class) and later in that year age 3 pollock (the 2008 year
class) were present. In 2012 - 2016 the 2008 year class was prominent in the
catches with 2015 showing the first signs of the 2012 year-class as three
year-olds in the catch (Fig. \ref{fig:catage}; Table \ref{tab:fsh_age}). The sampling
effort for age determinations, weight-length measurements, and length frequencies is shown in Tables \ref{tab:fsh_meas}, \ref{tab:lw_meas}, and \ref{tab:fsh_n}.
Sampling for pollock lengths and ages by area has been shown to be relatively
proportional to catches (e.g., Fig. 1.8 in Ianelli et al. 2004). 
The precision of total pollock catch biomass is considered high with estimated 
CVs to be on the order of 1\% (Miller 2005).

Scientific research catches are reported to fulfill requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act. The annual
estimated research catches (1963 - 2016) from NMFS surveys in the Bering Sea
and Aleutian Islands Region are given in (Table \ref{tab:res_catch}). Since
these values represent extremely small fractions of the total removals
(~0.02%) they are ignored as a contributor to the catches as modeled for
assessment purposes.

#Surveys
##Bottom trawl survey (BTS)

Trawl surveys have been conducted annually by the AFSC to assess the abundance
of crab and groundfish in the Eastern Bering Sea since 1979 and since 1982
using standardized gear and methods. For pollock, this survey has been
instrumental in providing an abundance index and information on the population
age structure. This survey is complemented by the acoustic trawl (AT) surveys
that sample mid-water components of the pollock stock. Between 1991 and 2017
the BTS biomass estimates ranged from 2.28 to 8.39 million t (Table
\ref{tab:bts_abund}; Fig. \ref{fig:bts_biom}). In the mid-1980s and early 1990s several
years resulted in above-average biomass estimates. The stock appeared to be at
lower levels during 1996-1999 then increased moderately until about 2003 and
since then has averaged just over 4 million t. These surveys provide
consistent measurements of environmental conditions, such as the sea surface
and bottom temperatures. Large-scale zoogeographic shifts in the EBS shelf
documented during a warming trend in the early 2000s were attributed to
temperature changes (e.g., Mueter and Litzow 2008). However, after the period
of relatively warm conditions ended in 2005, the next eight years were mainly
below average, indicating that the zoogeographic responses may be less
temperature-dependent than they initially appeared (Kotwicki and Lauth 2013).
Bottom temperatures increased in 2011 to about average from the low value in
2010 but declined again in 2012-2013. However, in 2014-2015 bottom
temperatures increased along with surface temperatures reached a
new high in 2016 and dropped to more average values this year (Fig. \ref{fig:bts_temp}) \footnote{The 
traditional area-swept design-based index is reported in some tables along with the density-dependent 
corrected index (Kotwicki et al. 2014) presented in past assessments used here.}. 

Beginning in 1987 NMFS expanded the standard survey area farther to the
northwest. The pollock biomass levels found in the two northern strata were
highly variable, ranging from 1% to 22% of the total biomass; whereas the 2014
estimate was 12%, 2015 was 7%, and in the past two years is slightly below the average
(5%) at 4%	 and 3% (Table \ref{tab:bts_biom}). In some years (e.g., 1997 and
1998) some stations had high catches of pollock in that region and this
resulted in high estimates of sampling uncertainty (CVs of 95% and 65% for
1997 and 1998 respectively). This region is contiguous with the Russian border
and these strata seem to improve coverage over the range of the exploited
pollock stock.

The 2017 biomass estimate (design-based, area swept) was 4.81 million t,
slightly below the average for this survey (4.84 million t). Pollock were
distributed more widely in 2017 compared to recent years 
and were abundant in locales cooler than 2$^\circ$C bottom temperatures
(Fig. \ref{fig:bts_temp_cpue}). The extent of distribution within the middle domain
is more apparent in Figure \ref{fig:bts_3d} which shows that the split in densities 
observed in the 2016 survey was absent in 2017.

The BTS abundance-at-age estimates show variability in year-class strengths
with substantial consistency over time (Fig. \ref{fig:bts_age}). Pollock above 40 cm in
length generally appear to be fully selected and in some years many 1-year
olds occur on or near the bottom (with modal lengths around 10-19 cm).  Age 2
or 3 pollock (lengths around 20-29 cm and 30-39 cm, respectively) are
relatively rare in this survey presumably because they are more pelagic as juveniles.
Observed fluctuations in survey estimates may be attributed to a variety of
sources including unaccounted-for variability in natural mortality, survey
catchability, and migrations. As an example, some strong year classes appear
in the surveys over several ages (e.g., the 1989 year class) while others
appear only at older ages (e.g., the 1992 and 2008 year class). Sometimes
initially strong year classes appear to wane in successive assessments (e.g.,
the 1996 year class estimate (at age 1) dropped from 43 billion fish in 2003
to 32 billion in 2007 (Ianelli et al. 2007). Retrospective analyses (e.g.,
Parma 1993) have also highlighted these patterns, as presented in Ianelli et
al. (2006, 2011). Kotwicki et al. (2013) also found that the catchability
of either the BTS or AT survey for pollock is variable in space and time because
it depends on environmental variables, and is density-dependent in the case of
the BTS survey.

The 2017 survey age compositions were developed from age-structures collected
during the survey (June-July) and processed at the AFSC labs within a few
weeks after the survey was completed. The level of sampling for lengths and
ages in the BTS is shown in (Table \ref{tab:bts_n}). The estimated
numbers-at-age from the BTS for strata (1-9 except for 1982-84 and 1986, when
only strata 1-6 were surveyed) are presented in Table \ref{tab:bts_age}
and contains the values used for the index which
accounts for density-dependence in bottom trawl tows (Kotwicki et al. 2014).
Mean body mass at ages from the survey are shown in (Table
\ref{tab:wt_bts}).

As in previous assessments, a descriptive evaluation of the BTS data alone was
conducted to examine mortality patterns similar to those proposed in Cotter et
al. (2004). The idea is to evaluate survey data independently from the
assessment model for trends. The log-abundance of age 5 and older pollock was
regressed against age by cohort. The negative values estimated for the slope
are estimates of total annual mortality. Age-5 was selected because younger
pollock appear to still be recruiting to the bottom trawl survey gear (based
on qualitative evaluation of age composition patterns). A key assumption of
this analysis is that all ages are equally available to the gear. Total
mortality by cohort seems to be variable (unlike the example in Cotter et al.,
2004). Cohorts from the early 1990s appear to have lower total mortality than
cohorts since the mid-1990s, which average around 0.4. Total
mortality estimates by cohort represent lifetime averages since harvest rates
(and actual natural mortality) vary from year to year. The low values
estimated for some year classes (e.g., the 1991 cohort) could be because these
age groups only become available to the survey at a later age (i.e., that the
availability/selectivity to the survey gear changed for these cohorts).
Alternatively, it may suggest some net immigration into the survey area or a
period of lower natural mortality. In general, these values are consistent
with the values obtained within the assessment models.

As described in the 2015 assessment, an alternative index that accounts for
the efficiency of bottom-trawl gear for estimating pollock densities was used
(Kotwicki et al. 2014). Based on comments from the CIE review, this index was
provided in biomass units in this assessment (previously the index was for
abundance). This biomass index was shown in Table \ref{tab:bts_abund} as noted above (the column labelled "DDC").

#Other time series used in the assessment

##Acoustic trawl (AT) surveys

The AT surveys are conducted biennially (most recently in 2016) and are
designed to estimate the off- bottom component of the pollock stock (compared
to the BTS which are conducted annually and provide an abundance index of the
near-bottom pollock). The number of trawl hauls, lengths, and ages sampled
from the AT survey are presented in (Table \ref{tab:ats_n}). Estimated
midwater pollock biomass (to 3m from bottom) for the shelf was above 4 million
tons in the early years of the time series (Table \ref{tab:bts_abund}). It
dipped below 2 million t in 1991, and then increased and remained between 2.5
and 4 million t for about a decade (1994-2004). The early 2000s (the ‘warm’
period mentioned above) were characterized by low pollock recruitment, which
was subsequently reflected in lower midwater biomass estimates between 2006
and 2012 (the recent ‘cold’ period; Honkalehto and McCarthy 2015). The
midwater pollock biomass estimate from the 2016 AT survey of 4.06 million is
above the average (2.76 million t; Table \ref{tab:ats_biom}). Relative
estimation errors for the total biomass were derived from a one-dimensional
(1D) geostatistical method (Petitgas 1993, Walline 2007, Williamson and
Traynor 1996) and account for observed spatial structure for sampling along
transects. As in previous assessments, the other sources of error (e.g.,
target strength, trawl sampling) were accounted for by inflating the annual
error estimates to have an overall average CV of 25% for application within
the assessment model (based on judgement relative to other indices). The
portion of shelf-wide biomass (from surface to 3m off-bottom) estimated to be
east of 170$^\circ$W was 37%, compared to an average of 24% since 1994 (Table
\ref{tab:ats_biom}).  Also, the distribution of pollock biomass within the SCA
was similar to that found in 2014 at 13% compared to the 2007-2012 average of
7% (and 1994-2016 average of 10%).

The 2016 EBS acoustic-trawl survey estimates of population numbers at age were
updated based on age-length keys from the AT survey (Fig. \ref{fig:at_age}).
Additionally, historical data were updated to account for the layer of pollock
detected between 0.5 and 3m from the bottom (previous estimates had use
pollock  estimates between the surface down to 3m from the bottom only). This
affected the  age compositions but differences were relatively minor (Fig.
\ref{fig:at_age_new}). As noted last year, the 2016 survey observed relatively
few age 1 pollock whereas age 3 (the 2013 year class) was the most abundant
age group followed by four year olds (Table \ref{tab:ats_age}).


##Biomass index from Acoustic-Vessels-of-Opportunity (AVO)

The details of how acoustic backscatter data from the two commercial fishing
vessels chartered for the eastern Bering Sea bottom trawl survey (BTS) are used
to compute a midwater abundance index for pollock can be found in Honkalehto
et al. (2011). This index was updated this year since there was no directed
acoustic-trawl survey in the EBS. This biomass series shows a steady increase
for the period 2009-2015 with  a slight drop in 2016 that continues in 2017
(Table \ref{tab:avo}).

A spatial comparison between the BTS data and AVO survey transects in 2016 and
2017 shows differences in the locales and densities of pollock both between
years and in their vertical densities within years (Fig. \ref{fig:avo_bts}). This figure
also shows that in both years the AVO survey detects densities that were
less apparent in the BTS data.


#Analytic approach
##General model structure

A statistical age-structured assessment model conceptually outlined in
Fournier and Archibald (1982) and like Methot’s (1990) stock synthesis model
was applied over the period 1964-`r thisyr`. A technical description is presented in
the Model Details section attached. The analysis was first introduced in the 1996 SAFE
report and compared to the cohort analyses that had been used previously and
was document Ianelli and Fournier 1998). The model was implemented using
automatic differentiation software developed as a set of libraries under the
C++ language (“ADMB,” Fournier et al. 2012). The data updated from last year’s
analyses include:

  - The `r thisyr` EBS bottom trawl survey estimates of population numbers-at-
    age and biomass were added.

  - The `r thisyr-1` EBS acoustic-trawl survey estimate of population numbers-
    at-age based on the actual age data (and age-length keys) from the AT survey 

  - The `r thisyr-1` fishery age composition data were added.     

A simplified version of the assessment (with mainly the same data and
likelihood-fitting method) is included as a supplemental multi-species
assessment model. As presented in 2016, it allows for trophic interactions
among key prey and predator species and for pollock, and it can be used to
evaluate age and time-varying natural mortality estimates in addition to
alternative catch scenarios and management targets (see this volume:
[EBS multi-species model](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/refm/stocks/plan_team/EBSmultispp.pdf)).

##Description of alternative models

Based on recent reviews and feedback from the SSC and Plan Team, a few model
configuration options were developed and implemented in 2016 and the main
model proposed here is based on the accepted model from last year.

At the September 2016 Plan Team meetings and subsequent SSC, presentations were
made describing preliminary results using the ATS data that covered the water
column down to 0.5m from the bottom. Due to issues with compiling the age
compositions for the new series, the plan was to incorporate and present these
results in the 2017 assessment. This was completed and now, based on SSC, Plan Team, and
CIE review recommendations, the time series where the acoustic return covers
the bottom layer between 0.5 and 3m from bottom is included in the ATS data.

###Input sample size

In 2016 we reevaluated specified sample sizes and the trade-offs with
flexibility in time and age varying selectivity.  This resulted in tuning the
recent era (1991-present year) to average sample sizes of 350 and then
estimated values for the intermediate and earliest period (Table
\ref{tab:input_n}).  We assumed average values of 100 and 50 for the BTS and
ATS data, respectively with inter-annual variability reflecting the
variability in the number of hauls sampled for ages. The tuning aspects for
these effective sample size weights were estimated following Francis 2011
(equation TA1.8, hereafter referred to as Francis weights).

##Parameters estimated outside of the assessment model

###Natural mortality and maturity at age

The baseline 16.0 model specification has been to use constant natural
mortality rates at age (M=0.9, 0.45, and 0.3 for ages 1, 2, and 3+
respectively based on earlier work of Wespestad and Terry 1984). These values
have been applied to catch-age models and forecasts since 1982 and appear
reasonable for pollock. When predation was explicitly considered estimates
tend to be higher and more variable (Holsman et al. 2015; Livingston and
Methot 1998; Hollowed et al. 2000). Clark (1999) noted that specifying a
conservative (lower) natural mortality rate may be advisable when natural
mortality rates are uncertain. More recent studies confirm this (e.g., Johnson et al. 2015). In the 2014 assessment different natural
mortality vectors were evaluated in which the “Lorenzen” approach and that of
Gislason et al (2010) were tested. The values assumed for pollock natural
mortality-at-age and maturity-at-age (for all models; Smith 1981) consistent
with previous assessments were:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\label{tab:dataextent}
\scalebox{0.9}{

\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}



In the supplemental multi-species assessment model alternative values of age
and time-varying natural mortality are presented. Those estimates indicate
higher values than used here. In last year's evaluation of natural mortality
it was noted that the  survey age compositions favored lower values of M while
the fishery age  composition favored higher values. This is consistent with
the patterns seen in the  BTS survey data as they show increased
abundances of “fully selected” cohorts. Hence, given the model specification
(asymptotic selectivity for the BTS age composition data), lower natural
mortality rates would be consistent with those data. Given these trade-offs,
structural model assumptions were held to be the same as previous years for
consistency (i.e., the mortality schedule presented above).

Maturity-at-age values used for the EBS pollock assessment are originally
based on Smith (1981) and were reevaluated (e.g., Stahl 2004; Stahl and
Kruse 2008a; and Ianelli et al. 2005). These studies found inter-annual
variability but general consistency with the current assumed schedule of
proportion mature at age. 


###Length and Weight at Age

Age determination methods have been validated for pollock (Kimura et al. 1992;
Kimura et al. 2006, and Kastelle and Kimura 2006). EBS pollock size-at-age
show important differences in growth with differences by area, year, and
year class. Pollock in the northwest area are typically smaller at age than
pollock in the southeast area. The differences in average weight-at-age are
taken into account by stratifying estimates of catch-at-age by year, area,
season, and weighting estimates proportional to catch.

The assessment model for EBS pollock accounts for numbers of individuals in
the population. As noted above, management recommendations are based on
allowable catch levels expressed as tons of fish. While estimates of pollock
catch-at-age are based on large data sets, the data are only available up
until the most recent completed calendar year of fishing (e.g., 2015 for the
assessment conducted in 2016). Consequently, estimates of weight-at-age in the
current year are required to map total catch biomass (typically equal to the
quota) to numbers of fish caught (in the current year). Therefore, these
estimates can have large impacts on recommendations (e.g., ABC and OFL).

The mean weight at age in the fishery can vary due to environmental conditions
in addition to spatial and temporal patterns of the fishery. Bootstrap
distributions of the within-year sampling variability indicate it is
relatively small compared to between-year variability in mean weights-at-age.
This implies that processes determining mean weights in the fishery cause more
variability than sampling (Table \ref{tab:wtage}). The coefficients of
variation between years are on the order of 6% to 9% (for the ages that are
targeted) whereas the sampling variability is generally around 1% or 2%. The
approach to account for the identified mean weight-at-age having clear year
and cohort effects was continued (e.g., Fig. \ref{fig:fsh_wtage}).  Details
were provided in appendix 1A of Ianelli et al. (2016). The results from this
method showed the relative variability between years and cohorts and provide
estimates (and uncertainty) for 2017-2019 (Table \ref{tab:wtage}).

##Parameters estimated within the assessment model

For the selected model, `r npar` parameters were estimated conditioned on data and
model assumptions. Initial age composition, subsequent recruitment, and stock-
recruitment parameters account for 77 parameters. This includes vectors
describing the initial age composition (and deviation from the equilibrium
expectation) in the first year (as ages 2-15 in 1964) and the recruitment mean
and deviations (at age 1) from 1964-2016 and projected recruitment variability
(using the variance of past recruitments) for five years (2018-2022). The two-
parameter stock-recruitment curve is included in addition to a term that
allows the average recruitment before 1964 (that comprises the initial age
composition in that year) to have a mean value different from subsequent
years. Note that the stock-recruit relationship is fit only to stock and
recruitment estimates from 1978 year-class through to the 2014 year-class.

Fishing mortality is parameterized to be semi-separable with year and age
(selectivity) components. The age component is allowed to vary over time;
changes are allowed in each year. The mean value of the age component is
constrained to equal one and the last 5 age groups (ages 11-15) are specified
to be equal. This latter specification feature is intended to reduce the
number of parameters while acknowledging that pollock in this age-range are
likely to exhibit similar life-history characteristics (i.e., unlikely to
change their relative availability to the fishery with age). The annual
components of fishing mortality result in 55 parameters and the age-time
selectivity schedule forms a 10x54 matrix of 540 parameters bringing the total
fishing mortality parameters to 595. The rationale for including time-
varying selectivity has recently been supported as a means to improve
retrospective patterns (Szuwalksi, Ianelli, and Punt 2017) and as best
practice (Martell and Stewart, 2013).

For surveys and indices, the treatment of the catchability coefficient, and
interactions with age-specific selectivity require consideration. For the BTS
index, selectivity-at-age is estimated with a logistic curve in which   year
specific deviations in the parameters is allowed. Such time-varying survey
selectivity is estimated to account for changes in the availability of pollock
to the survey gear and is constrained by pre-specified variance terms. For the
AT survey, which originally began in 1979 (the current series including data
down to  0.5m from bottom begins in 1994), optional parameters to allow for
age and time-varying patterns exist but for this assessment and other recent
assessments, ATS selectivity is constant over time.  Overall, five
catchability coefficients were estimated: one each for the early fishery
catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data (from Low and Ikeda, 1980), the early bottom
trawl survey data (where only 6 strata were surveyed), the main bottom trawl
survey data (including all strata surveyed), the AT survey data, and the AVO
data. An uninformative prior distribution is used for all of the indices. The
selectivity parameters for the 2 main indices total 135 (the CPUE and AVO data
mirror the fishery and AT survey selectivities, respectively).

Additional fishing mortality rates used for recommending harvest levels are
estimated conditionally on other outputs from the model. For example, the
values corresponding to the $F_{40\%}$ $F_{35\%}$ and $F_{MSY}$ harvest rates are found by
satisfying the constraint that, given age-specific population parameters
(e.g., selectivity, maturity, mortality, weight-at-age), unique values exist
that correspond to these fishing mortality rates. The likelihood components
that are used to fit the model can be categorized as:

*	Total catch biomass (log-normal, $\sigma=0.05$)    
* Log-normal indices of pollock biomass; bottom trawl surveys assume annual
 estimates of sampling error, as represented in Fig. \ref{fig:bts_biom}; for the AT index
 the annual errors were specified to have a mean of 0.25; while for the AVO
 data, a value relative to the AT index was estimated and gave a mean of
 about 0.30).
*	Fishery and survey proportions-at-age estimates (multinomial 
 	with effective sample sizes presented Table \ref{tab:`r tablab[23]`}).      
*	Age 1 index from the AT survey (CV set equal to 30% as in prior assessments).    
*	Selectivity constraints: penalties/priors on age-age variability, time changes, 
    and decreasing (with age) patterns.    
*	Stock-recruitment: penalties/priors involved with fitting a stochastic 
  stock-recruitment relationship within the integrated model.     
*	“Fixed effects” terms accounting for cohort and year sources of variability
   in fishery mean weights-at-age estimated based on available data from 1991-2016
   and externally estimated variance terms as described in Appendix 1A of Ianelli et al. (2016).    

Work evaluating temperature and predation-dependent effects on the stock-
recruitment estimates continues (Spencer et al. 2016). This approach modified
the estimation of the stock-recruitment relationship by including the
effect of temperature and predation mortality. A relationship between
recruitment residuals and temperature was noted (similar to that found in
Mueter et al., 2011) and lower pollock recruitment during warmer conditions
might be expected. Similar results relating summer temperature conditions to
subsequent pollock recruitment for recent years were also found by Yasumiishi
et al. (2015). The extent that such relationships affect the stock-recruitment
estimates (and future productivity) is a continuing area of research.

#Results
##Model evaluation

The limited models presented (with and without the revised acoustic survey
biomass estimates and age compositions compared to last year's selected model,
here denoted 16.0) shows a slight drop in spawning biomass estimates relative
to last year (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_eval0a}). The recent recruitment pattern (at age
1) shows an increase in  the 2014 value (representing the 2013 year-class) but
was otherwise quite similar (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_eval0b}). Based on past
recommendations by the CIE, SSC, and Plan Team, the model using the acoustic trawl 
survey data extending from the surface to 0.5m from the bottom (16.0a) was selected
for this year's reference/base model.

The fits to the bottom-trawl survey biomass (the density-dependent corrected series) 
appears to be reasonable (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_biom}). Similarly, the fits to the 
acoustic-trawl survey biomass series is consistent with the specified observation
uncertainty (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_ats_biom}). 


The estimated parameters and standard errors are provided [online](https://goo.gl/8whZ8h)
 and summary model results are given in Table \ref{tab:res_summ}. 
 The code for the model (with dimensions and links to parameter names) and input files are available upon request.

The input sample size (as tuned in 2016 using "Francis Weights") can be
evaluated visually for consistency with expectations of mean annual age for
the different gear types (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_mean_age}; Francis 2011). The
estimated selectivity pattern  changes over time and reflects to some degree
the extent to which the fishery is focused on particularly prominent year-
classes (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_fsh_sel}). The model fits the fishery age-
composition data quite well under this form of selectivity (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_fsh_age}). The fit to the early Japanese fishery CPUE data (Low
and Ikeda 1980) is consistent with the population trends for this period (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_cpue_fit}). The fit to the fishery- independent index from the
2006-2017 AVO data shows  a relatively stable trend in recent years (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_avo_fit}).

Bottom-trawl survey selectivity (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_sel}) and fits to the
numbers of age 2 and older pollock indicate that the model predicts fewer
pollock than observed in the 2014 and 2015 survey but slightly more than
observed in the 2012, 2013 and in 2016-17 (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_biom}). The
pattern of bottom trawl survey age composition data in recent years shows a
decline in the abundance of older pollock since 2011. The 2006 year-class
observations are below model expectations in 2012 and 2013, partly due to the
fact that in 2010 the survey estimates are greater than the model predictions
(Fig. \ref{fig:mod_bts_age}). In 2017 the model predicted higher proportions of 
age 5 and age 9 than observed whereas the survey observations indicated a 
higher-than-expected proportion of 4-year olds (the 2013 year class).

The fit to the numbers of age 2 and older pollock in the AT
survey generally falls within the confidence bounds of the survey sampling
distributions (here assumed to have an average CV of 25%) with a reasonable
pattern of residuals (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_ats_biom}). The AT age compositions
consistently track large year classes through the population and the model
fits these patterns reasonably well (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_ats_age}).

As in past assessments, an evaluation of the multivariate posterior distribution 
was performed by running a chain of 3 million Monte-Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) simulations
and saving every 600th iteration (final posterior draws totalled 5,000). A pairwise comparison
for some key parameters could be evaluated (along with their marginal distributions; 
Fig. \ref{fig:mcmc_pairs}). To compare the point estimates (highest posterior density) with
the mean of the posterior marginal distribution, overplotting the former on the latter
for the 2017 spawning biomass estimate were nearly identical (Fig. \ref{fig:mcmc_marg}). 


##Time series results
The time series of begin-year biomass estimates (ages 3 and older) suggests
that the abundance of Eastern Bering Sea pollock remained at a high level from
1981-88, with estimates ranging from 8 to 12 million t (Table \ref{tab:biom_3plus}). 
Historically, biomass levels increased from 1979 to
the mid-1980s due to the strong 1978 and relatively strong 1982 and 1984 year
classes recruiting to the fishable population. The stock is characterized by
peaks in the mid-1980s, the mid-1990s and again appears to be increasing to
new highs over 13 million t following the low in 2008 of 4.9 million t.

The level of fishing relative to biomass estimates show that the spawning
exploitation rate (SER, defined as the percent removal of egg production in
each spawning year) has been mostly below 20% since 1980 (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_ser}).
During 2006 and 2007 the rate averaged more than 20% and the average fishing
mortality for ages 3-8 increased during the period of stock decline. The
estimate for 2009 through 2016 was below 20% due to the reductions in TACs
relative to the maximum permissible ABC values and increased in the spawning
biomass. The average F (ages 3-8) increased in 2011 to above 0.25 when the TAC
increased but has dropped since then and in 2016 is estimated at about 0.16.
Age specific fishing mortality rates reflect these patterns and show some
increases in the oldest ages from 2011-2013 but also indicate a decline in
recent years (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_F}). The estimates of age 3+ pollock biomass
were mostly higher than the estimates from previous years (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_hist},
Table \ref{tab:biom_3plus}).

To evaluate past management and assessment performance it can be useful to
examine estimated fishing mortality relative to reference values. For EBS
pollock, we computed the reference fishing mortality from Tier 1 (unadjusted)
and recalculated the historical values for $F_{MSY}$ (since selectivity has changed
over time). Since 1977 the current estimates of fishing mortality suggest that
during the early period, harvest rates were above $F_{MSY}$ until about 1980. Since
that time, the levels of fishing mortality have averaged about 35% of the $F_{MSY}$ 
level (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_phase}).

##Recruitment
Model estimates indicate that both the 2008 and 2012 year classes are well
above average (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_rec}). The stock-recruitment curve as
fit within the integrated model shows a fair amount of variability both in the
estimated recruitments and in the uncertainty of the curve (Fig.
\ref{fig:mod_srr}). Note that the 2015 and 2016 year classes (as age 1 recruits in
2016 and 2017) are excluded from the stock-recruitment curve estimation.
Separate from fitting the stock- recruit relationship within the model,
examining the estimated recruits-per-spawning biomass shows variability over
time but seems to lack trend and also is consistent with the Ricker stock-
recruit relationship used within the model (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_rs}).

Environmental factors affecting recruitment are considered important and
contribute to the variability. Previous studies linked strong Bering Sea
pollock recruitment to years with warm sea temperatures and northward
transport of pollock eggs and larvae (Wespestad et al. 2000; Mueter et al.
2006). As part of the Bering-Aleutian Salmon International Survey (BASIS)
project research has also been directed toward the relative density and
quality (in terms of condition for survival) of young-of-year pollock. For
example, Moss et al. (2009) found age-0 pollock were very abundant and widely
distributed to the north and east on the Bering Sea shelf during 2004 and 2005
(warm sea temperature; high water column stratification) indicating high
northern transport of pollock eggs and larvae during those years. Mueter et
al. (2011) found that warmer conditions tended to result in lower pollock
recruitment in the EBS. This is consistent with the hypothesis that when sea
temperatures on the eastern Bering Sea shelf are warm and the water column is
highly stratified during summer, age-0 pollock appear to allocate more energy
to growth than to lipid storage (presumably due to a higher metabolic rate),
leading to low energy density prior to winter. This then may result in
increased over-winter mortality (Swartzman et al. 2005, Winter et al. 2005).
Ianelli et al. (2011) evaluated the consequences of current harvest policies
in the face of warmer conditions with the link to potentially lower pollock
recruitment and noted that the current management system is likely to face
higher chances of ABCs below the historical average catches.


##Retrospective analysis
Running the assessment model over a grid with progressively fewer years
included (going back to 20 years, i.e., assuming the data extent ended in
1997) results in a fair amount of variability in both spawning biomass and
recruitment (Fig. \ref{fig:mod_retro}) Although the variability is high, the
average bias appears to be low with Mohn’s $\rho$ equal to `r round(rhoMohn10,3)`
 for the 10 year retrospective and `r round(rhoMohn20,3)` if extended  back 20-years.

#Harvest recommendations

The estimate of $B_{MSY}$ is `r bmsys` kt (with a CV of `r round(100*(bmsy.sd/bmsy),0)`\%) 
which is less than the projected `r nextyr` spawning biomass of `r nextyrssbs` kt; 
(Table \ref{tab:res_summ}).  For `r thisyr`, the Tier 1 levels of yield are `r maxabc1s` t from a fishable biomass
estimated at around `r ABC_biom1s` kt  (Table \ref{tab:tier1_proj}). Estimated
numbers-at-age are presented in (Table \ref{tab:est_n}) and estimated catch-
at-age is presented in (Table \ref{tab:est_catage}). Estimated summary biomass
(age 3+), female spawning biomass, and age-1 recruitment are given in 
(Table \ref{tab:biom_ssb_rec}).

Model results indicate that spawning biomass will be above $B_{40\%}$ 
(`r nextyrssbs` kt) in `r nextyr` and about `r round(ssb1/bmsy*100,0)`\% 
of the $B_{MSY}$ level. The probability that the current
stock size is below 20\% of $B_{0}$ (based on estimation uncertainty alone) is <0.1\%
for `r thisyr+1` and `r nextyr+1`.

A diagnostic (see appendix on model details) on the impact of fishing shows that the
`r thisyr` spawning stock size is about `r round(100*dynb0,0)`\%  of the
predicted value had no fishing occurred since 1978 (Table
\ref{tab:res_summ}). This compares with the `r round(100*curssb/b100,0)`\% 
of $B_{100}$\% (based on the SPR expansion using mean recruitment from 1978-2015) 
and `r round(100*curssb/bmsy,0)`\%
of $B_{0}$ (based on the estimated stock-recruitment curve). The latter two
values are based on expected recruitment from the mean value since 1978 or
from the estimated stock recruitment relationship.

##Amendment 56 Reference Points

Amendment 56 to the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) defines
overfishing level (OFL), the fishing mortality rate used to set OFL (FOFL),
the maximum permissible ABC, and the fishing mortality rate used to set the
maximum permissible ABC. The fishing mortality rate used to set ABC (FABC) may
be less than this maximum permissible level, but not greater. Estimates of
reference points related to maximum sustainable yield (MSY) are currently
available. However, their reliability is questionable. We therefore present
both reference points for pollock in the BSAI to retain the option for
classification in either Tier 1 or Tier 3 of Amendment 56. These Tiers require
reference point estimates for biomass level determinations. Consistent with
other groundfish stocks, the following values are based on recruitment
estimates from post-1976 spawning events:

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{lr}
$B_{MSY}$    &=	`r bmsys` kt female spawning biomass    \\
$B_{0}$      &=	`r b0s` kt female spawning biomass    \\
$B_{100\%}$  &=	`r b100s` kt female spawning biomass   \\
$B_{40\%}$   &=	`r b40s` kt female spawning biomass    \\
$B_{35\%}$   &=	`r b35s` kt female spawning biomass    \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

##Specification of OFL and Maximum Permissible ABC

Assuming the stock-recruit relationship the `r nextyr` spawning
biomass is estimated to be `r ssb1s` t (at the time of spawning, assuming the
stock is fished at about recent catch levels). This is above the $B_{MSY}$ value of
`r bmsys`,000 t. Under Amendment 56, this stock has qualified under Tier 1 and the
harmonic mean value is considered a risk-averse policy since reliable
estimates of $F_{MSY}$ and its pdf are available (Thompson 1996). The exploitation-
rate type value that corresponds to the $F_{MSY}$ level was applied to the fishable
biomass for computing ABC levels. For a future year, the fishable biomass is
defined as the sum over ages of predicted begin-year numbers multiplied by age
specific fishery selectivity (normalized to the value at age 6) and mean body
mass. The uncertainty in the average weights-at-age projected for the fishery and
“future selectivity” has been demonstrated to affect the buffer between ABC
and OFL (computed as 1-ABC/OFL) for Tier 1 maximum permissible ABC (Ianelli et al. 2015).
The uncertainty in
future mean weights-at-age had a relatively large impact as did the selectivity
estimation.

Since the `r nextyr` female spawning biomass is estimated to be above the $B_{MSY}$ level
(`r bmsys` kt) and the $B_{40\%}$ value (`r b40s` kt) in `r nextyr` and if the `r thisyr` catch
is as specified above, then the OFL and maximum permissible ABC values by the
different Tiers would be:
```{r abctab13}
df <- data.table(Tier=c("1a","1a","3a","3a"), Year=c(nextyr,nextyr+1,nextyr,nextyr+1),
	              MaxABC=c(maxabc1s,maxabc2s,abc1s,abc2s),OFL=c(ofl1s,ofl2s,Tier3_OFL1s,Tier3_OFL2s))
tab <- xtable(df, digits = c(0,0,0,0,0),big.mark="," )
print(tab,include.rownames=F,big.mark=",",hline.after=c(-1,0,2,nrow(tab)))
```

##Standard Harvest Scenarios and Projection Methodology

A standard set of projections is required for each stock managed under Tiers
1, 2, or 3 of Amendment 56. This set of projections encompasses seven harvest
scenarios designed to satisfy the requirements of Amendment 56, the National
Environmental Policy Act, and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act (MSFCMA). While EBS pollock is generally considered to fall
within Tier 1, the standard projection model requires knowledge of future
uncertainty in $F_{MSY}$ . Since this would require a number of additional
assumptions that presume future knowledge about stock-recruit uncertainty, the
projections in this subsection are based on Tier 3.

For each scenario, the projections begin with the vector of `r thisyr` numbers at
age estimated in the assessment. This vector is then projected forward to the
beginning of `r nextyr` using the schedules of natural mortality and selectivity
described in the assessment and the best available estimate of total (year-
end) catch assumed for `r thisyr`. In each subsequent year, the fishing mortality
rate is prescribed on the basis of the spawning biomass in that year and the
respective harvest scenario. Annual recruits are simulated from an inverse
Gaussian distribution whose parameters consist of maximum likelihood estimates
determined from the estimated age-1 recruits. Spawning biomass is
computed in each year based on the time of peak spawning and the maturity and
weight schedules described in the assessment. Total catch is assumed to equal
the catch associated with the respective harvest scenario in all years. This
projection scheme is run 1,000 times to obtain distributions of possible
future stock sizes and catches under alternative fishing mortality rate
scenarios.

Five of the seven standard scenarios will be used in an Environmental Assessment prepared in conjunction
with the final SAFE. These five scenarios, which are designed to provide a range of harvest alternatives
that are likely to bracket the final TAC for 2018, are as follow (“$maxFABC$” refers to the maximum
permissible value of FABC under Amendment 56):

\begin{description}
\item[Scenario 1:]   
In all future years, $F$ is set equal to max$F_{ABC}$. (Rationale:  Historically,
TAC has been constrained by ABC, so this scenario provides a likely upper
limit on future TACs).

\item[Scenario 2:]   
In `r nextyr; print("and"); nextyr+1` the catch is set equal to 1.35 million t
and in future years $F$ is set equal to the Tier 3 estimate (Rationale: this was
has been about equal to the catch level in recent years).

\item[Scenario 3:]   
In all future years, $F$ is set equal to the `r thisyr-6;print("-");thisyr-1` average $F$. (Rationale:
For some stocks, TAC can be well below ABC, and recent average $F$ may provide a
better indicator of $F_{TAC}$ than $F_{ABC}$.)

\item[Scenario 4:]   
Scenario 4: In all future years, $F$ is set equal to $F_{60\%}$. (Rationale:  This
scenario provides a likely lower bound on $F_{ABC}$ that still allows future
harvest rates to be adjusted downward when stocks fall below reference levels.

\item[Scenario 5:]   
Scenario 5: In all future years, $F$ is set equal to zero. (Rationale:  In
extreme cases, TAC may be set at a level close to zero.)

\item[Scenario 6:]   
In all future years, F is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale:  This scenario
determines whether a stock is overfished. If the stock is expected to be 
1) below its MSY level in `r thisyr` or 2) below half of its MSY level in `r thisyr` or below
its MSY level in `r thisyr +10` under this scenario, then the stock is overfished.)

\item[Scenario 7:]   
In `r nextyr` and `r nextyr+1`, F is set equal to $maxFABC$, and in all subsequent years, F
is set equal to $F_{OFL}$. (Rationale:  This scenario determines whether a stock is
approaching an overfished condition. If the stock is 1) below its MSY level in
`r nextyr+1` or 2) below 1/2 of its MSY level in `r nextyr+1` and expected to be below its MSY
level in `r thisyr+12` under this scenario, then the stock is approaching an
overfished condition).

\end{description}

The latter two scenarios are needed to satisfy the MSFCMA’s requirement to
determine whether a stock is currently in an overfished condition or is
approaching an overfished condition. These two scenarios are as follow (for
Tier 3 stocks, the MSY level is defined as $B_{35\%}$):

#Projections and status determination 
For the purposes of these projections,
we present results based on selecting the $F_{40\%}$ harvest rate as the max FABC
value and use $F_{35\%}$ as a proxy for $F_{MSY}$. Scenarios 1 through 7 were projected
14 years from `r thisyr` (Tables \ref{tab:tier3_C} through \ref{tab:tier3_SSB}). Under the maximum permissible catch level in
Tier 3, the expected spawning biomass will decline until 2020 and stabilize
slightly above $B_{40\%}$ (in expectation, Fig. \ref{fig:tier3_proj}).

Any stock that is below its minimum stock size threshold (MSST) is defined to
be overfished. Any stock that is expected to fall below its MSST in the next
two years is defined to be approaching an overfished condition. Harvest
scenarios 6 and 7 are used in these determinations as follows:

Is the stock overfished? This depends on the stock’s estimated spawning
biomass in `r thisyr`:

* If spawning biomass for `r thisyr ` is estimated to be below 1/2 $B_{35\%}$ the stock is below its MSST.   

* If spawning biomass for `r thisyr ` is estimated to be above $B_{35\%}$, the stock is above its MSST.   

* If spawning biomass for `r thisyr` is estimated to be above 1/2 $B_{35\%}$ but below $B_{35\%}$,
 the stock’s status relative to MSST is determined by referring to harvest
 scenario 6 ((Tables \ref{tab:tier3_C} through \ref{tab:tier3_SSB}). If the mean spawning biomass for
 `r thisyr + 10` is below $B_{35\%}$, the stock is below its MSST. Otherwise, the stock is
 above its MSST.

Is the stock approaching an overfished condition?  This is determined by referring to harvest Scenario 7:

* If the mean spawning biomass for 2018 is below 1/2 $B_{35\%}$, the stock is approaching an overfished condition.  

* If the mean spawning biomass for 2018 is above $B_{35\%}$, the stock is not approaching an overfished condition.  

* If the mean spawning biomass for `r nextyr+1` is above 1/2 $B_{35\%}$ but below $B_{35\%}$, the
  determination depends on the mean spawning biomass for 2028. If the mean
  spawning biomass for `r nextyr+11` is below $B_{35\%}$, the stock is approaching an
  overfished condition. Otherwise, the stock is not approaching an overfished
  condition.

For scenarios 6 and 7, we conclude that pollock is above MSST for the year `r thisyr`, 
and it is not expected to be approaching an overfished condition
based on Scenario 7 (the mean spawning biomass in `r thisyr` is above the
$B_{35\%}$ level; (Table \ref{tab:tier3_SSB}). Based on this, the EBS pollock
stock is being fish below the overfishing level and the stock size is above
the overfished level and projected to stay above based on the national status
determination criteria.

##ABC Recommendation
ABC levels are affected by estimates of $F_{MSY}$ which depends principally on
the estimated stock-recruitment steepness parameter, demographic schedules
such as selectivity-at-age, maturity, and growth. The current stock size (both
spawning and fishable) is estimated to be  at above-average levels and
projections indicate declines.  Updated data and analysis result in an
estimate of `r thisyr` spawning biomass (`r curssbs` kt) which is about 
`r round(100*curssb/bmsy,0)`\% of $B_{MSY}$ (`r bmsys` kt). The replacement
yield—defined as the catch next year that is expected to achieve a `r nextyr`
spawning biomass estimate equal to that from `r thisyr`--is estimated to be about
`r repl_ylds` t.

The EBS pollock stock appears to have rebounded from the 2008 low point and
shows significant increases due to two strong year classes (2008 and 2012).
However, there remain several concerns about the medium-term stock conditions.
Namely,

1.  The conditions in summer 2017 followed a warm period, precaution may be
warranted since warm conditions are thought to negatively affect the survival
of larval and juvenile pollock.

2.  The near-term prognosis for  survey found very few one-year-old pollock in
summer 2016 and 2017 (the BTS data show below average 1-year olds).

3.  The recent BTS data continue to show low abundances of pollock aged 10 and older (Table \ref{tab:bts_age}).
Historically there had been good representation of older fish in data from
this survey. This is somewhat expected given the poor year-classes observed
during the period 2000-2005.

4.  There is apparently a considerable amount of pollock showing up in the 
    northern part of the shelf beyond the traditional survey area (on the order
    of 1.3 million t). The extent that these fish are related to those that might
    move  back to the normal fishing areas is unknown (in 2010 the ecosystem survey 
    of the NBS showed very few pollock). 

5.  The multispecies model suggests that the $B_{MSY}$ level is around 3.6 million
t instead of the ~`r round(bmsy/1000,1)` million t estimated in the current assessment (noting that
the total natural mortality is higher in the multispecies model).

9.  Pollock are an important prey species for the ecosystem and apparent changes in the 
    distribution may shift their availability as prey. 

10. Whilst outside of ABC considerations, it seems that maintaining the stock
at relatively high levels and achieving fishery catch rates observed since
2016 may help with keeping Chinook and other salmon bycatch impacts at their esimated low levels. 

11. Finally, given the same estimated aggregate fishing effort in 2017, the estimated stock trend is
    downwards except at low catch levels (a replacement yield of `r repl_ylds` kt is the amount that would
    maintain the spawning stock constant). Furthermore, the ability to catch the same amount as in `r thisyr` 
    through to 2021 will require about 25% more effort with a decline in spawning biomass of about 20% compared to
    the current level (based on expected average recruitment; Fig. \ref{fig:proj_const_catch}).  

Given these factors, a `r nextyr` ABC of `r abc1s` t is recommended based on the
Tier 3 estimates as conservatively selected by the SSC since 2014. We
recognize that the actual catch will be constrained by other factors (the 2
million t OY BSAI groundfish catch limit; bycatch avoidance measures). The
alternative maximum permissible Tier 1a ABC seems clearly risky. Such high
catches would result in unprecedented variability and removals from the stock
(and considerably more capacity and effort). Adopting a more stable catch
system would also result in less spawning stock variability.

#Ecosystem considerations
In general, a number of key issues for ecosystem conservation and management can be highlighted. These include: 

*	Preventing overfishing;    

*	Avoiding habitat degradation;    

*	Minimizing incidental bycatch;    

*	Monitoring bycatch and the level of discards; and    

*	Considering multi-species trophic interactions relative to harvest policies.    

For the case of pollock in the Eastern Bering Sea, the NPFMC and NMFS continue
to manage the fishery on the basis of these issues in addition to the single-
species harvest approach (Hollowed et al. 2011). The prevention of overfishing
is clearly set out as the main guideline for management. Habitat degradation
has been minimized in the pollock fishery by converting the industry to
pelagic-gear only. Bycatch in the pollock fleet is closely monitored by the
NMFS observer program and managed on that basis. Discard rates of many species
have been reduced in this fishery and efforts to minimize bycatch continue.

In comparisons of the Western Bering Sea (WBS) with the Eastern Bering Sea
using mass-balance food-web models based on 1980-85 summer diet data, Aydin et
al. (2002) found that the production in these two systems is quite different.
On a per-unit-area measure, the western Bering Sea has higher productivity
than the EBS. Also, the pathways of this productivity are different with much
of the energy flowing through epifaunal species (e.g., sea urchins and
brittlestars) in the WBS whereas for the EBS, crab and flatfish species play a
similar role. In both regions, the keystone species in 1980-85 were pollock
and Pacific cod. This study showed that the food web estimated for the EBS
ecosystem appears to be relatively mature due to the large number of
interconnections among species. In a more recent study based on 1990-93 diet
data (see Appendix 1 of the Ecosystem Considerations chapter for methods),
pollock remain in a central role in the ecosystem. The diet of pollock is
similar between adults and juveniles with the exception that adults become
more piscivorous (with consumption of pollock by adult pollock representing
their third largest prey item).

Regarding specific small-scale ecosystems of the EBS, Ciannelli et al. (2004a,
2004b) presented an application of an ecosystem model scaled to data available
around the Pribilof Islands region. They applied bioenergetics and foraging
theory to characterize the spatial extent of this ecosystem. They compared
energy balance, from a food web model relevant to the foraging range of
northern fur seals and found that a range of 100 nautical mile radius encloses
the area of highest energy balance representing about 50% of the observed
foraging range for lactating fur seals. This has led to a hypothesis that fur
seals depend on areas outside the energetic balance region. This study
develops a method for evaluating the shape and extent of a key ecosystem in
the EBS (i.e., the Pribilof Islands). Furthermore, the overlap of the pollock
fishery and northern fur seal foraging habitat (see Sterling and Ream 2004,
Zeppelin and Ream 2006) will require careful monitoring and evaluation.

A brief summary of these two perspectives (ecosystem effects on pollock stock
and pollock fishery effects on ecosystem) is given in (Table \ref{tab:pscbycatch}). Unlike the
food-web models discussed above, examining predators and prey in isolation may
overly simplify relationships. This table serves to highlight the main
connections and the status of our understanding or lack thereof.


##Ecosystem effects on the EBS pollock stock 

The pollock stock condition appears to have benefitted substantially from the
recent conditions in the EBS. The conditions on the shelf during 2008
apparently affected age-0 northern rock sole due to cold
conditions and apparently unfavorable currents that retain them into the over-
summer nursery areas (Cooper et al. 2014). It may be that such conditions
favor pollock recruitment. Hollowed et al. (2012) provided an extensive review
of habitat and density for age-0 and age-1 pollock based on survey
data. They noted that during cold years, age-0 pollock were distributed
primarily in the outer domain in waters greater than 1$^\circ$C and during warm
years, age-0 pollock were distributed mostly in the middle domain. This
temperature relationship, along with interactions with available food in
early-life stages, appears to have important implications for pollock
recruitment success (Coyle et al. 2011). The fact that the 2012 year-class
appears to be strong, as it ages that contribution to the stock will 
diminish.

A separate section presented again this year updates a multispecies model with
more recent data and is presented as a supplement to the BSAI SAFE report. In
this approach, a number of simplifications for the individual species data and
fisheries processes (e.g., constant fishery selectivity and the use of
design-based survey indices for biomass). However, that model mimics the
biomass levels and trends with the single species reasonably well. It also
allows specific questions to be addressed regarding pollock TACs. For example,
since predation (and cannibalism) is explicitly modeled, the impact of
relative stock sizes on subsequent recruitment to the fishery can be now be
directly estimated and evaluated (in the model presented here, cannibalism is
explicitly accounted for in the assumed Ricker stock-recruit relationship).


Euphausiids make up a large component of the pollock diet. The euphausiid abundance on the
Bering Sea shelf is presented as a section of the 2017 Ecosystem
Considerations Chapter of the SAFE report and shows a continued decline in
abudance since the peak in 2009 (for details see De Robertis et al. (2010) and
Ressler et al. (2012). The role that the apparent recent 2009 peak abundance
had in the survival of the 2008 year class of EBS pollock is interesting.
Contrasting this with how the feeding ecology of the 2012 year class (also
apparently well above average) may differ is something to evaluate in the
future.

##EBS pollock fishery effects on the ecosystem. 

Since the pollock fishery is primarily pelagic in nature, the bycatch of non-
target species is small relative to the magnitude of the fishery 
(Table \ref{tab:nontargbycatch}).
Jellyfish represent the largest component of the bycatch of non-target species
and had averaged around 5-6 kt per year but more than doubled in
2014 but has dropped in 2015 and been about average since then. The data on non-target species shows a high
degree of inter-annual variability, which reflects the spatial variability of
the fishery and high observation error. This variability may reduce the
ability to detect significant trends for bycatch species.

The catch of other target species in the pollock fishery represent less than
1% of the total pollock catch. Incidental catch of Pacific cod has increased
since 1999 but remains below the 1997 levels (Table \ref{tab:fmpbycatch}). The incidental
catch of flatfish was variable over time and has increased, particularly for
yellowfin sole. Proportionately, the incidental catch has decreased since the
overall levels of pollock catch have increased. In fact, the bycatch of
pollock in other target fisheries is more than double the bycatch of target
species in the pollock fishery (Table \ref{tab:pollbycatch}).

The number of non-Chinook salmon (nearly all made up of chum salmon) taken incidentally
has steadily increased since 2014 with 2017 number in excess of 465 thousand fish (more than
double the 2003-2017 average of 227 thousand fish; Table \ref{tab:pscbycatch}).
Chinook salmon bycatch has also increased steadily since 2012 with the 2017
counts at just over 30,000 (which is 18% below the 2003-2017 mean value). 
However, this is the highest value since
the implementation of Amendment 91 in 2011 (Table \ref{tab:pscbycatch}). 
Ianelli and Stram (2014) provided estimates of the bycatch impact on Chinook salmon runs to the coastal west
Alaska region and found that the peak bycatch levels exceeded 7% of the total
run return. Since 2011, the impact has been estimated to be below 2%. Updated estimates 
given new genetic information and these levels of PSC will be provided in the future. 


#Data gaps and research priorities

The available data for EBS pollock are extensive yet many processes behind the
observed patterns are poorly understood. 
For example, the northern Bering Sea ecosystem survey conducted in 2017 found substantial amounts of pollock
compared to the  previous survey done in 2010.
Research on developing and testing plausible
hypotheses about the underlying processes that cause such observations is
needed. This should include examining potential effects of temporal changes in
survey stations and using spatial processes for estimation purposes (e.g.,
combining acoustic and bottom trawl survey data). The application of the
geostatistical methods (presented for comparative purposes in the 2016 assessment) seems like a
reasonable approach to statistically model disparate data sources for
generating better abundance indices.

More studies on spatial dynamics, including the relationship between climate
and recruitment and trophic interactions of pollock within the ecosystem would
be useful for improving ways to evaluate the current and alternative fishery
management system. In particular, studies investigating the processes
affecting recruitment of pollock in the different regions of the EBS
(including potential for influx from the GOA) should be pursued.

Many studies have found inconclusive evidence for genetic population structure
in walleye pollock. Knowledge of stock structure is particularly important for
this species, given its commercial importance and continued questions about 
geographic extent into the Russian zone and the northern Bering Sea. 
Therefore, **funding for a large scale study
using the highest resolution genetic tools available is recommended.** Samples have
been coordinated and are continuing with plans for samples from the February 2018
Bogoslof Island region survey. This study is occurring at a criticul juncture and 
funding for processing these samples is needed.
